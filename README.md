# Welcome to My Yelp
My_Yelp

## Task
Deploy an application built in ReactJS into Amplify (AWS) using authentification.
We've provided to you the code of an application and we would like it to be hosted in the cloud.
This application is also using GraphQL, you might have to take a look. You are one hundred percent allowed to edit the source code; your mission is simple: make it work.
## Description
You've been assigned by your manager to deploy an old application to the cloud.
It's an excellent timing since you've just completed your training on AWS.
A mix of Amplify, lambda and other technology will be perfect for this project. A little about Yelp (source wikipedia):
Yelp was founded in 2004 by former PayPal employees Russel Simmons and Jeremy Stoppelman. Yelp grew in usage and raised several rounds of funding in the following years. By 2010, it had $30 million in revenue, and the website had published about 4.5 million crowd-sourced reviews. From 2009 to 2012, Yelp expanded throughout Europe and Asia. In 2009, it entered unsuccessful negotiations to be acquired by Google. Yelp became a public company via an initial public offering in March 2012 and became profitable for the first time two years later.

## Installation
In the project directory, you can run:

`npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.
The page will reload when you make changes.
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

`npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.

`npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\


## Usage
